>>>[!bug]- Consists of 3 parts :
>>>- name service :
>>>	- it is UDP port 137
>>>	- it associate the NetBIOS name to an IP
>>>	- detect conflict if multiple name or IP occurred in the network.
>>>	- the name composite of 16 cahr, only 15 for your use, the 16 for the system(for identifying the service on the pc.)
>>>		- ![[Pasted image 20240705143500.png]]
>>>---
>>>-  Datagram service :
>>>	- it is UDP port 138
>>>	- allow sending and receiving messages to NetBIOS name.
>>>	- use it if you want to send a message to all devices in the same network like command `wall`.
>>>---
>>>- Session service :
>>>	- it is TCP port 139
>>>	- for establish connection to allow file sharing and exchanging.
