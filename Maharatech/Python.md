>[!tip]- The Advantages:
>
>>[!success] Cross platform:
>>- you can program with python in many operating system.
>---
>>[!success] could be used for many purposes.
>
>>[!success] Interpreter:
>>- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

>[!caution]- Interpreter & Compiler:
>- different ways to execute code
>---
>>[!danger]- Interpreter:
>>- directly execute instructions without the need to be compiled into machine form.
>>---
>>- Execution:
>>	- line by line and from any point.
>>- Performance:
>>	- slower due to the translation at runtime.
>>- debugging:
>>	- easy, you can execute the code line by line and see the result immediately without the need to compile the entire code first.
>>---
>>- like javascript and php.
>---
>>[!danger]- Compiled:
>>- Compile the code first then run.
>>---
>>- Execution:
>>	- the entire code translated at once then execute.
>>- Preformance:
>>	- faster, because of the translation before executing.
>>- Debugging:
>>	- slower, due to the need to compile the entire code before execute it.

## Syntax:

>[!tip]- TIPS:
>- No need to define a datatype for any variable.
>
>- the type automatically assign to the variable after assign a value to it without specifying.
>
>- the body of the function must be shifted from the header to the right >>.
>
>- you can make a function in anywhere and it wouldn't be executed until you call it.
>
>
>
>- ==#== for comments and there are no multi lines comments, but you can use ``` your comments ``` and the python will ignore it while compilation so technically it is comment ...!!

>[!todo]- Data Types & Casting & Assigning Values:
>- int, float, tuple, string, mapping, boolean, dictionary, list, data, complex ....
>	- int(v) -> for casting to int, the string should be number
>	- str(v) -> converting v into string.
>---
>- type():
>	- a function for knowing the data type.
>	- can be used inside the print() function
>---
>- float:
>	- for indicating power of 10
>		- 5e2          ->         5*10^2 = 5*100
>		- 5E2
>		- -32e20
>	- for indicating fractions
>		- 53.21
>		- -4.2
>---
>- complex:
>	- for complex number, r + j
>		- 3 + 2j
>		- 5j
>		- -5j
>---
>>[!tip]- Casting:
>>- converting datatypes to another, str, int, float
>>----
>>- str(var):
>>	- for converting the var into str
>>----
>>- and so on for int & float
>---
>>[!caution]- Different types for assigning values:
>>- x, y, z = 3, 4, 5
>>	- you can define variables in one line.
>>----
>>- x = y = z = "Potato"
>>	- for assign the same value to all variables, you need to use =.
>>- you can extract values form a list and store it in variables like this:
>>	![[Pasted image 20240530011239.png]]
>>----
>>- global (var):
>>	- for calling the global variable by reference in a local function.
>>	- changing the global variable value.
>>	- you can use global variable without type global 'var' but you can't modify it.
>>----

>[!danger]- Print & Scan:
>- print("the text you want to print..")
>	- it automatically put a new line for each print
>	- with " ", for print the same syntax as entered.
>	- without " ", for print variables if found.
>- print("the comment", variable)
>	- for printing the comment then the variable.
>---
>- print(f"your comment and {variable name} to print them")
>	- using f is instead of .format() function
>
>- print("your comment with {}".format(variable))
>	- the format function work as extent, by ' . '
>	- the format function remove any {} and put the variable
>	- the number of argument = num of {}.
>---
>- print(x, end = "  ")
>	- for printing the variable x and space only, without a new line.
>- print()
>	- for printing a new line.
>---
>>[!tip]- input:
>>- x = input("comment you want")
>>	- the input always be a string, so we need casting.

>[!caution]- Conditions:
>
>>[!help] if:
>>- if 5 > 2:
>> __ print("five is greater than two!")
>>	- you need to make a tap for the function body. instead of the previous underline. it is important that the function body be shifted than the head of the condition.
>>	- you need to put ' : ' in the end of the condition.

>[!success]- Lists & Tuples:
>>[!tip]- List:
>>- you can modify and change elements after creating it.
>>- defined using {}
>>---
>>- list = [3 , 4 , 5]
>>	- now this is a list of 3 component.
>>	- the iteration start form 0.
>---
>>[!todo]- Tuple:
>>- you cannot change or modify the elements after creating it.
>>- defined using ()
>>- more memory efficient and faster.
>>---
>>- tuple(1, 2, 3)
>>	- tuple of 3 component

>[!Failure]- Loops:
>
>>[!caution]- For:
>>- for [iteration variable name] in [lists, array of char, range(num)] ==:==  
>>	- you can use multiple iteration variables.
>>	- you declare the variable in for loop and it's value depend on the second part of the for loop variable.
>>		- for example: 
>>			- if we put a list, the {i} will have all the values in the list, strings, character, int ,....
>>			- if we use range(5), {i} will have all values from 0 to 4,   (5 - 1)
>>			- if we use one string, {i} will walk through its characters and will have each character value.
>---
>---
>>[!tip]- Additional Conditions:
>>- continue
>>	- for skip the current iteration and begin from the next one.
>>---
>>- break
>>	- to stop the loop.
>>	- just type it in a line.
>>---
>>- range()
>>	- a function returnÂ sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
>>	- range (6):
>>		- from 0 to 5
>>	- range (2,8):
>>		- from 2 to 7
>>	- range (2, 30, 3):
>>		- from 2 to 30 and increment by 3 each time.
>>---
>>- pass
>>	- for loop cannot be empty so we use pass in case of non usage of the for loop.
>>---

>[!caution]- Functions:
>- you can use a global variable name inside the function and assign a new value to it as local one without affecting the global variable...
>- use (global var) to change the value of the global variable inside function.
>----
>- def name(argument):
>     - this is the prototype header of a function in python
>     - ==you need to put ' : ' in the end.==
>     - always use def.
>     - __the function body is shifted to the right >> than the header, instead of {} in C++__.
> 
>----
