>- it is type of attacks toward a specific system that is running a specific operation system like windows or linux.
>- the network service was not the only attack method
>- this attacks usually come after you have gained access to a target network, an exploitation method.
>- i think phishing link attack is a part of it.

>- each system has vulnerability with its operating system
>- if a system work with older version, you can search for available vulnerabilities rather than searching for it, and may be there are a ready exploitation for them .......
>- always do the OS fingerprint

>>[!caution]- The weaknesses inside windows systems .
>>- information disclosure :
>>	- when the attacker can access a special data or secret data.
>>- Buffer overflows :
>>	- an programming error that allow the attacker to write a data to the memory, the data may be malicious.
>>- Remote code execution :
>>	- allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the target machine
>>	- very dangerous
>>- Privilege escalation :
>>	- elevate their privileges to higher one
>>- Denial of Service (DOS) :
>>	- it is to consume all resources to prevent the system functionality from running normally.
>>	- very important in wars, i guess ...


>[!caution] windows exploitation services :
