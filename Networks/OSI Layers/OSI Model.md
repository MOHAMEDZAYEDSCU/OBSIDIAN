## What is it?
>[!tip] Definition
>- Open Systems Intercommunication, (OSI meaning)
>- it is the way of how systems communicate between each other.
>- Type of a Network.

>[!example]- consists of 7 layers.
> -  physical layer
> - data link
> - network
> - transport
> - session
> - presentation
> - application




## Example & Brief about each Layer:

>[!caution]- Intro
2 men in 2 different locations around the world and they need to send each other a message through app(for example) so,
it will pass the seven layers and each layer has it's process on data...
>>[!tip] it will be (APSTNDP ابستندب)

>[!tip]- 1
first, the message will be in the application layer which has the **data + ALH**
>>[!caution]-
>>- DNS work here to convert human readable to ip.
>>- cookies: to save your information, {get -> data in url, post -> data in http (more secure)}.
>
>>[!danger]- HTTPS:
>>- encrypted http using TLS(SSL) protocol.
>>- more secure than http.
>>- you can't encrypt the ip address.

>[!important]- 2
>- the message will go to the presentation layer to be classify the data into categories by its type (image, video, characters, etc ...) it is like to compress the data with classification. (PLH)
>- it is like the data after changes its type.
 
 >[!tip]- 3 
then go to session layer to know which device has send the message by it's port and determine the channel. (SLH).

>[!tip]- 4
then go to transport layer to know which protocol is used and make sure that the data will be send correctly (TLH).

>[!tip]- 5
then go to network layer to know which IP we will send the data to and determine the path to that IP. (NLH)

>[!tip]- 6
then go to data link layer to know the mac address and some switch information. (DLH)

>[!tip]- 7 
and finally go to physical layer to convert the digital data to a physical signal to be sent through cables.

## Full detailed Layers:
### (1) [[7- Physical Layer|Physical Layer]]
### (2) [[6- Data-Link Layer|Data-Link Layer]]
### (3) [[5- Network Layer|Network Layer]]
- very very important
### (4) [[4- Transport Layer|Transport Layer]]
### (5,6) [[2,3- Session & Presentation Layer|Session & Presentation Layer]]
### (7) [[1- Application Layer|Application Layer]].
