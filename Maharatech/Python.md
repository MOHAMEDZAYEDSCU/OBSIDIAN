>[!tip]- The Advantages:
>
>>[!success] Cross platform:
>>- you can program with python in many operating system.
>---
>>[!success] could be used for many purposes.
>
>>[!success] Interpreter:
>>- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

>[!caution]- Interpreter & Compiler:
>- different ways to execute code
>---
>>[!danger]- Interpreter:
>>- directly execute instructions without the need to be compiled into machine form.
>>---
>>- Execution:
>>	- line by line and from any point.
>>- Performance:
>>	- slower due to the translation at runtime.
>>- debugging:
>>	- easy, you can execute the code line by line and see the result immediately without the need to compile the entire code first.
>>---
>>- like javascript and php.
>---
>>[!danger]- Compiled:
>>- Compile the code first then run.
>>---
>>- Execution:
>>	- the entire code translated at once then execute.
>>- Preformance:
>>	- faster, because of the translation before executing.
>>- Debugging:
>>	- slower, due to the need to compile the entire code before execute it.

## Syntax:

>[!tip]- TIPS:
>- python has no command for declaring a variable.
>- the type automatically assign to the variable after assign a value to it without specifying. 
>- as a part of a function, you must be shifted from the header.
>- ==#== for comments and there are no multi lines comments, but you can use ``` your comments ``` and the python will ignore it while compilation so technically it is comment ...!!
>-  

>[!todo]- Data Types & Casting:
>- type():
>	- for knowing the data type.

>>[!caution]- Different types for assigning values:
>>- x, y, z = 3, 4, 5
>>	- you can define variables in one line.
>>- x = y = z = "Potato"
>>	- for assign the same value to all variables, you need to use =.
>>- you can extract values form a list and store it in variables like this:
>>	- ![[Pasted image 20240530011239.png]]
>>- 

>[!danger]- Print & Scan:
>- print("the text you want to print..")
>	- it automatically put a new line for each print
>	- double coots " " for print the same syntax as entered.
>	- without " ", for print variables if found.
>- print("the comment", variable)
>	- for printing the comment then the variable.
>	- 
>---
>- print(x, end = "  ")
>	- for printing the variable x and space only, without a new line.
>- print()
>	- for printing a new line.
>---
>>[!tip]- input:
>>- x = input("comment you want")

>[!caution]- Conditions:
>
>>[!help] if:
>>- if 5 > 2:
>> __ print("five is greater than two!")
>>	- you need to make a tap for the function body. instead of the previous underline. it is important that the function body be shifted than the head of the condition.
>>	- you need to put ' : ' in the end of the condition.

>[!success]- Lists & Arrays:
>- Array = [3 , 4 , 5]
>	- now this is a list of 3 component.
>	- the iteration start form 0

>[!Failure]- Loops:
>
>>[!caution]- For:
>>- for [iteration variable name] in [lists, array of char, range(num)]
>>	- you can use multiple iteration variables.
>>	- the iteration variable names start from 0 without initiating them.
