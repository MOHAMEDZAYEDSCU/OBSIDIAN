>[!todo]- StepsofRecon :
>- 1- you try to collect passive information as you can (DNS, IP, firewalls used, os version, and all possible information)
>---
>>[!caution]- 1 :
>>- go to `netcraft.com` and enter `your dns` ==~`website` :==
>>	- it will show a lot of data about website and `virustotal`
>>- or use `whois [DNS]` ==~`terminal` :==
>>	- it will show you a lot of sub-domains `DNS` and the IP(maybe).

>>[!caution]- 2 :
>>- use `nslookup [DNS]` ==~`terminal`:==

>>[!bug]- 3 :
>>- use `nmap [argumentAsNeeded] [target_IP]` ==~`terminal` :==
>>- **to scan the network for open ports and services.**

>>	- if the request denied, 2 possibilities (closed or firewall used) :
>>		- use `nmap -Pn [IP]`
>>			- if ip reply with the information so it was the firewall that block the first request...
>>			- `-Pn` to not wait for the `icmp` reply, just scan the network.
>>		- `nmap -Pn -sV -p [80] [IP]` :

>>- now you has open ports and the application that use it with the version of the service.. (very important).
