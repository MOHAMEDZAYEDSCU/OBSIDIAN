>- Analysis the network and Detect live hosts.
>- will use the default gate way for it, cause it connect the network devices together like the switch. use `ipconfig, ifconfig` to know that info.
>	- knowing your ip address.
>	- knowing the default gateway
>	- knowing the sub-net mask
>- using `nmap` command to discover hosts.
>	- `nmap IP/mask --open`
>		- ==for search for open hosts and their IP with their open ports with services (specially SMB service) -> was work on port 445== 
>		- `IP` will be yours but replace the last section with 0.(depend on the `sub-net mask`)
