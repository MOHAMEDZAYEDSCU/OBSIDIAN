>[!question]- What is Physical Layer?
>- It is the lowest layer of OSI and Determine How we physically devices connected.
>- Responsible for converting the digital binary data to a signal which move in physical cables.
## Network Topology
>[!tip] Definition
>- it is a way of how devices are physically connected with a network.
>- it is the layer that specify the way which the data will be transmitted like (light signals, electrical or wireless) connection.
>- it has 3 types.

>[!example]- Star Topology
>- the router or switch -> will be the central node and a lot of devices connected to it.
>- Most used
>
>>[!success] Pros
>> - each node directly connected to the central node which make it faster and more efficient
>> - isolation of devices.
>
>>[!failure] Cons
>>- single point of failure which make the entire network to have problems if something happened the central node.

>[!example]- Ring Topology
> - like a ring, each node is connected to other 2 nodes
> - no central node
>
>> [!success] Pros
>> - no significantly advantages of this topology !!
>
>> [!failure] Cons
>> - data in one direction
>> - if any node breaks, it will disturb the entire system.
>> - difficult to add a new device to the system.

>[!example]- Bus Topology
>- all nodes share the same cable
>- one node can transmit at a time
>- share the same bandwidth
>- all the data is available for all devices in the network.
>
>>[!success] Adv
>> - easy to install
>> - cheap due to coaxial cable & BNC connectors.
>
>>[!failure] DisAdv
>> - The more nodes added The degrades the performance, bad in high traffic.
>> - less security, allow sniffing
>> - lead to collisions


## Transmission modes:
- describe the way which the data is transmitted between devices.

>[!tip]- Simplex Mode:
>- between 2 devices and only one can transmit data and the other can only receive the data.
>
>>[!example]-
>>- keyboard
>>- TV
>>- monitors.

>[!tip]- Half-Duplex Mode:
>- Both can send and receive data but only one at the time not simultaneously.
>
>>[!example]-
>>- Railway track

>[!tip]- Full-Duplex Mode:
>- both devices can send and receive simultaneously.
>
>>[!example]-
>>- telephones
>>- chatting applications.
