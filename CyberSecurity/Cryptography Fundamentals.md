>[!success]- Key terms:
>- plain text:
>	- the data which we want to secure it to send it to another person
>- cipher:
>	- the encryption algorithm which may be with the same key for encrypt and decrypt or different keys.
>- cryptoanalysis:
>	- a bad activity by attacker to try to know the keys by analysis the cipher text.

>[!caution]- Cryptography:
>- is a way for secure messages by converting it from an recognition form to another form which no one can understand it except specific peoples.

>> [!Example]
>> - symmetric model
>>	- the sender and receiver have the same key for encryption and decryption.
>>	- the key should be private and no one know about it except its nodes.
>> - asymmetric model
>>	- the sender has a key for encryption and the receiver has a different key for decryption.
>>	- away secure, and the receiver will generate both the encryption and decryption keys and let the encryption key public.

>[!tip]- Encryption Schemes:
>
>>[!caution] Unconditionally secure:
>>- the cipher text generated by the encryption key isn't have enough information about the encryption and you can't decrypt it without having the decryption key.
>>- like otp -> one time password
>>- امان غير حسابي لا يمكن حساب طريقة تشفيرة لفكه
>
>>[!caution] Computationally Secure:
>>- when the cost of decrypting the cipher exceed the exceed the value of information and the time required for breaking it exceeded the useful lifetime of the informations.

>[!caution]- General:
>>[!success]- CryptoAnalysis:
>>- it is about how the attacker will find the key based on the available information.
>>- it has some knowledge about the encryption algorithm or the plain text.
>>- depend on the key space ?? small or large.
>>
>>>[!example]- Types of Attacks:
>>>- cipher text only:
>>>	- know the ciphertext only
>>>
>>>- known plaintext:
>>>	- ciphertext along with some info about plaintext. 
>>>
>>>- chosen plaintext:
>>>	- ciphertext with the encryption algorithm.
>>>
>>>- chosen ciphertext:
>>>	- ciphertext along with the decryption algorithm.
>>>
>>>- chosen text:
>>>	- have the plaintext with the ciphertext and try to predict the keys.
>
>>[!success]- Brute-Force attack:
>>- trying all possible values in order to find the key.
>>- Guessing.
>>- Exhaustive key search.
>>---
>>- you can prevent this type by using Captcha to ensure that there are no machine doing the brute force.
>>	- text based
>>	- recaptcha
>>	- mathematical
>>	- image based
>>	- 3d, and more ...
