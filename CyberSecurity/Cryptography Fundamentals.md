## Intro:

>[!success]- Key terms:
>- plain text:
>	- the data which we want to secure it to send it to another person
>- cipher:
>	- the encryption algorithm which may be with the same key for encrypt and decrypt or different keys.
>- cryptoanalysis:
>	- a bad activity by attacker to try to know the keys by analysis the cipher text.

>[!caution]- Cryptography:
>- is a way for secure messages by converting it from an recognition form to another form which no one can understand it except specific peoples.
>
>> [!Example]
>> - symmetric model
>>	- the sender and receiver have the same key for encryption and decryption.
>>	- the key should be private and no one know about it except its nodes.
>> - asymmetric model
>>	- the sender has a key for encryption and the receiver has a different key for decryption.
>>	- away secure, and the receiver will generate both the encryption and decryption keys and let the encryption key public.

>[!tip]- Encryption Schemes:
>
>>[!caution] Unconditionally secure:
>>- the cipher text generated by the encryption key isn't have enough information about the encryption and you can't decrypt it without having the decryption key.
>>- like otp -> one time password
>>- امان غير حسابي لا يمكن حساب طريقة تشفيرة لفكه
>
>>[!caution] Computationally Secure:
>>- when the cost of decrypting the cipher exceed the exceed the value of information and the time required for breaking it exceeded the useful lifetime of the informations.

## Finding the key by:

>[!success]- CryptoAnalysis:
>- it is about how the attacker will find the key based on the available information.
>- it has some knowledge about the encryption algorithm or the plain text.
>- depend on the key space ?? small or large.
>
>>[!example]- Types of Attacks:
>>- cipher text only:
>>	- know the ciphertext only
>>
>>- known plaintext:
>>	- ciphertext along with some info about plaintext. 
>>
>>- chosen plaintext:
>>	- ciphertext with the encryption algorithm.
>>
>>- chosen ciphertext:
>>	- ciphertext along with the decryption algorithm.
>>
>>- chosen text:
>>	- have the plaintext with the ciphertext and try to predict the keys.

>[!success]- Brute-Force attack:
>- trying all possible values in order to find the key.
>- Guessing.
>- Exhaustive key search.
>---
>- you can prevent this type by using Captcha to ensure that there are no machine doing the brute force.
>	- text based
>	- recaptcha
>	- mathematical
>	- image based
>	- 3d, and more ...
>
>>[!example]- tools for making the brute-force:
>>- aircrack-ng
>>- creack
>>- hydra
>>- john the ripper
>>- hashcat

>>[!caution]- Important Notations:
>>- careful when you try it to not harm anyone without your purpose....
 

## Classical Encryption Techniques:

>[!caution]- Substitution Technique :
>- replace the letters with other letters or symbols.
>- shifting the languages characters by a specific shift is also type of it.
>- simple and may be easily broken.
>- known by both sender and receiver.

>[!caution]- Transposition Technique:
>- applying some sort or permutation to the letters of the word but it still have the same characters.
>- it is like shift or reverse or make a specific permutation as preferred on the word without changing its characters.
