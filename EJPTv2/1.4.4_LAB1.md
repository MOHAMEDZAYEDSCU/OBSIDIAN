- using metasploit
- try to find a metasploit module available for perfom the hacking

>[!todo]- Steps :
>- 1
>	- knowing your ip and sub-net mask and make sure that the target is up and work
>---
>- 2
>	- using nmap to discover all the machines with its open ports
>	- `nmap -Pn [T_IP]`
>		- `-Pn` if you are sure that the target is alive, skip host discovery.
>	- now you has all open ports with its services.
>---
>- 3
>	-  we was focus on port 445 for the SMB protocol, now we will focus on port 80 !!
>	- `nmap -sV -p80 [T_IP]`
>		- for showing more information about the open port 80 and the application that use that service.

>	- using metasploit to see if you has a script for exploiting the application or detected services
>	- `searchsploit` -> an additional search tool to meta
>	- ![[Pasted image 20240706142232.png]]
>	- now it will show you the available vulnerabilities to use
>---
>- 5
>	- open metasploit `msfconsole`
>	- it will open something like a shell
>---
>- 6
>	- give the path to the script

>	- you need to provide the target ip, use RHOST ...

>	- type exploit and enter :)
>	- the result will be like this

>- 9
>	- now you need to open a remote execution command by
>		- typing `shell` and enter
>		- will open a remote execution command shell
>	- use linux commands to navigate the files and folders
>	- you are asked for finding file `flag.txt` for this mission
>	- `type FileName` -> for showing its content like `cat`
