- scanning network like previous but using `SMBMap` tool.
- you are specifically search for `smb` bugs inside a windows machines.
- you mission is to get access to a machine in the same network as you.

>[!todo]- Steps :
>- 1
>	- `ifconfig || ipconfig` to know your ip and the sub-net mask of the network.
>---
>- 2
>	- `nmap [IP/mask]` to scan all the devices in the same network
>		- for selecting your target based on open ports ==(open 445 specifically)== and weak services, scanning or enum ??
>		- scanning for ==tcp== by default
>			- the sub-net mask detect the network , devices.
>			- see [[5- Network Layer|Network Layer]] for more details.

>- 4 
>	- `nmap -p445 --script smb-protocols [Tar_IP]`

>		- will show you the service on that protocol to too.

>	- `smbmap -u guest -p "" -d . -H [Tar_IP]`
>		- smbmap -> the tool
>		- `-u guest` -> for the user name
>		- `-p ""` -> for empty password , for authentication
>		- `-d .` -> for the current directory, idk why ?
>		- `-H [Targ_IP]` -> for the host (target)
>	- it will show you information about target directory that is open to share and its permission for you with the service name.

>	==- these scenarios is not real because you already has the admin username and the password and you are inside the network==
>		- but it teach you how to go if you has those informations, just a small training to show you a part of the hacking process :(

>	- `smbmap -H [TarIP] -u [AdminName] -p [AdminPass] -x 'command'` -> single ' '

- the most important step is uploading files to the target machine and downloading files...
