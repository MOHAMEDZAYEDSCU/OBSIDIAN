>[!caution]- What is Hacking?
>- use any bugs or vulnerability to access the system and use its features.
>- could steal, encrypt or corrupt the data.

>[!tip]- types of Hackers?
>- the main different between legal hackers and others is the permissions...
>----
>- black hat(cracker):
>	- penetrate and destroy systems.
>---
>- white hat:
> 	 - penetrate and defend the system.
> ----
> - suicide hacker:
> 	- a suicidal hacker who just want to destroy the system and don't care if he would be caught or not.
> ----
> - script kiddies:
> 	- unskilled hackers who just learn the tools and scripts by specific steps.
> -----
> - terrorist hacker:
> 	- motivated by religion or politics to spread fear by large scale >> nice.

>[!success]- Some Terminologies:
>
>>[!tip]- Hack Value:
>>- what is the value that the hacker will gain of the penetration operation
>>- it is worth or not.
>
>>[!caution]- Vulnerability:
>>- a weakness. ثغرة
>
>>[!quote]- Exploit:
>>- as a verb -> penetrate
>>- as a noun -> the tool used to achieve the operation.
>
>>[!tip]- Payload:
>>- part of the exploit code that tell the system admin who they can access the system illegally
>
>>[!caution]- ZeroDay attack:
>>- system is attacked the vendors is unaware of the attack.
>>- very dangerous.
>
>>[!danger]- Daisy Chaining:
>>- Using network device to gain access to other network devices.
>>- like jackpot 
>
>>[!caution]- Doxing:
>>- Collecting data from different websites
>
>>[!tip]- Bot:
>>- software inside the hacked before systems that execute instruction by remotely command and control center.

## Info Sec:

>[!danger]- Info Sec:
>- information security
>---
>>[!caution]- Elements of infosec:
>>
>>>[!todo]- Confidentiality:
>>>- the component security and privacy
>>
>>>[!success]- Integrity:
>>>- the data correction, the data can't be modified without its owner of specific people.
>>
>>>[!danger]- Availability:
>>>- your data always be available
>>>- like online marketing stores.

>[!caution]- Defense in Depth:
>- multiple layers of defense.
>- like complex password, host firewall and network firewall.

## Threats & Attack Vector:

>[!caution]- APT:
>- advances persistent threats
>- focus in attacking and stealing information from the user without being aware of it.
>- Stuxnet Worm, shamoon Malware. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>[!danger]- Another Types:
>- Host Attacks.
>- System Attacks.
>- Network Attacks.
>- Application & Mobile Threats.
>---
>- every one has its own detail but i will talk about lately...

## Hacking Phases:

- There are 5 phases.

>[!success]- Reconnaissance:
>- Information gathering about target.
>----
>- know security posture.
>- reduce focus area and chose appropriate target
>- identify vulnerability
>- draw network map to clarify your thoughts.
>- 
>---
>>[!caution]- Passive:
>>- collecting the data without any interaction with the target.
>
>>[!caution]- Active:
>>- collecting information with interacting with the target, like:
>>	- make interview in the company.
>>	- be a technical support
>>	- attend its events and so on.

>[!tip]- Scanning:
>- Live Hosts -> machines have services.
>- Port Scanning -> open ports or services.

>[!caution]- Gaining Access | Exploitation:
>- try to check and use vulnerabilities and information i have to perform my attack.

>[!danger]- Maintaining Access:
>- by making trojan injection, malware or backdoor to access the system anytime easily.

>[!Bug]- Clearing Tracks:
>- Hiding Malicious Acting
>- Avoid Suspicion
>- Unnoticed Continue Access.
