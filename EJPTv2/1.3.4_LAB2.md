- you will access through linux machine
- the real enumeration process, semi professional
- try to hack a specific IP inside your network...
- Good luck :)

>[!todo]- Steps :
>- first, make a ping test to test if the target machine is live or not...
>	- `pint -c 5 Target_IP`
>	- now you are sure about your target state
>---
>- first of all, you has multiple versions of (SMB) service, so you will need a script to test all the versions with the `nmap` command.
>	- search for it on internet with `script smb-protocols`
>- use 
>	- `nmap -p445 --script smb-protocols [Target_IP]`
>	- now it scan for smb versions. to detect your methodology.
>---
>- use `nmap -p445 --script smb-security-mode [Target_IP]`
>	- for more security information about the smb target ports and services.
>	- to know it would be easy of not to pentest that port
>	- it is not a 100% accuracy, so it depend on you skill level.
>---
>- `nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-sessions [Target_IP]`
>	- for knowing the user name that are working there.
>	- work for weaker versions (the old ones).

>- if no result appeared !!
>- `nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-sessions  --script-args smbusername=adminstrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 [Target_IP]`
>	- to use it, you should has the username and password of the system.
>---
>- after entering the network as a guest, try to see shared files by :
>- `nmap -p445 --scripts smb-enum-shares Targ_IP`
>	- if it give you any information, the system will be weak as duck
>	- sample of output :
>		- ![[Pasted image 20240705195436.png]]
>- if you found a READ/WRITE authority, it is a disaster for them and an EID for me :)
>	- it is named (Null session connection).
>---
>- you try to know the users inside the network by credintials(username and password)
>- ![[Pasted image 20240705200337.png]]
>	- the first line is the command used.
>	- for knowing the users and some information about them.
>---
>- `nmap -p445 --script smb-server-stats --script-args smbusername=adminstrator,smbpassword=smbserver_771 [Target_IP]`
>	- for knowing the logs, very useful.
>---
>- in future, you will use the previous information for attacking active directories(Advanced). it is mean you try to control and access the network controller to have access over all the network.
